# android/repository

This is a set of scripts for creating a mirror of Android Repository for Android SDK Manager (both standalone and Android Studio built-in) to download SDK packages from.

It's ideal for a classroom, [Study Jams](http://developerstudyjams.com/), and [Code labs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?cat=Android).

Tested on 

* Linux Mint Maya (13, Ubuntu 10.04)/Rebecca (17.1, Ubuntu 14.04),
* Cygwin on Windows 7 64bit
* OS X Mavericks (10.9.5)

## Prerequisites

You'll need a lot of free storage on your disk, about 48GB as of 2017-07-09.

### Linux

sudo apt-get install xsltproc

TODO test on redhat, yum install xsltproc

### OS X

It's recommended to use homebrew to install wget.

### Cygwin

 * wget
 * xslt - The two packages you must have are libxml2 and libxslt, both available under the Libs category.

## For Android Studio Built-in SDK Manager

### Server (Repository) setup

Note
* Files will be downloaded to your working directory.
* ANDROID_REPOSITORY_HOME is the directory holding the files of the project.
* A sample httpd vhost config will be printed on download complete

```
${ANDROID_REPOSITORY_HOME}/download2.sh
```

### Client (Android Studio) setup

Set environment variable before launching Android Studio.

Linux

```
export SDK_TEST_BASE_URL=http://studyjams.dushu.hu/android/repository/
android-studio/bin/studio.sh
```

macOS

```
export SDK_TEST_BASE_URL=http://studyjams.dushu.hu/android/repository/
open -a 'Android Studio'
```

Windows

```
set SDK_TEST_BASE_URL=http://studyjams.dushu.hu/android/repository/
android-studio-windows/bin/studio64.exe
```

Ref. https://android.googlesource.com/platform/sdk/+/tools_r14

## For Standalone SDK Manager

### Server (Repository) setup

Note
* Files will be downloaded to your working directory.
* ANDROID_REPOSITORY_HOME is the directory holding the files of the project.
* A sample httpd vhost config will be printed on download complete

```
${ANDROID_REPOSITORY_HOME}/download.sh
```

### Client (SDK Manager) setup

Assuming your mirror will be hosted on studyjams.dushu.hu, the following will setup a client. Note. Java 8 is required.
```
MIRROR_HOST=studyjams.dushu.hu
OS=linux
#OS=darwin
#OS=windows
wget http://${MIRROR_HOST}/`wget http://${MIRROR_HOST}/studio/ -O - | perl -nle "print $& if m{android/repository/sdk-tools-${OS}-\d+.zip}"`
unzip sdk-tools-*.zip
tools/bin/sdkmanager --no_https --proxy=http --proxy_host=${MIRROR_HOST} --proxy_port=80 "patcher;v4" "extras;android;m2repository" "extras;google;m2repository" emulator "build-tools;25.0.3" "platforms;android-25" platform-tools tools "sources;android-25"
```

Tips: The settings are saved to
```
~/.android/repositories.cfg
```

Sample [repositories.cfg](repositories.cfg)

The command line version of standalone SDK manager replaces the GUI version, since [SDK Tools, Revision 25.2.3 (November 2016)](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/sdk-tools.html)

Now these slides serves as an archive of how the project originated, https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JnGpK3YJrMY-f3M0pq6RkyAu2p-wct6DCwCOacCDGO8/pub

### (Optional) SDK web manager setup

It's a single page app for exploring the packages downloaded. To make it work,
 1. In your web root directory, (backup your index.html, and) run

```
${ANDROID_REPOSITORY_HOME}/setup-sdk-web-manager.sh
```

 It will copy over three files and one directory.
  * index.html
  * .bowerrc
  * bower.json
  * elements/
 2. Install bower (requires nodejs, https://nodejs.org/), and run the following command line
 3. bower i -F -S
